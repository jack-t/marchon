Both of us went to the women's march last month, and so it was on our minds' a few days ago as we were brainstorming. We kept coming back to the frustrations we felt during the march--especially when plans changed and no one seemed to be able to find out. Facebook events, where the march was organized, wouldn't load on the shoddy cell service. Calls were iffy.

The challenges at the Women's March led us to realize that there is a better way to protest. We call it MarchOn.
