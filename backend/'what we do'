March On lets protesters get real-time updates about emergencies and changes of plan so that they can march more effecgively

March On lets protestors focus on the protest by giving them the tools to be prepared--even when there's an emergency or the march route changes. Organizers can forget about the logistics--we've got that--so they can pay attention to their cause. Protestors get peace of mind in knowing that they'll stay ahead of changing conditions.
